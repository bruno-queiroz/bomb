# Bomb - A simple game designed to test your luck!

This project was originally thought of by me. I only had a basic idea of how it should be, so I decided to start building it and add new features as I came up with new ideas. It's a simple game designed to test your luck!

```
git clone https://github.com/bruno-queiroz/bomb.git
